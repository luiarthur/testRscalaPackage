# testRscalaPackage
Test to see if an RScala package will load properly

# R Package Skeleton Generation:
First, install the required packages by:

```R
install.packages("devtools")
library("devtools")
devtools::install_github("klutometis/roxygen")
```

To generate the directory structure of your package,
execute in R `package.skeleton("packageName")`.

Manually remove the generate `NAMESPACE` file. 
(It will be replaced by one generated by roxygen2.
But roxygen2 requires that the file not already exist.)

Then, to generate documentation by running the bash
script `gen.R` by doing this in a terminal:

`./gen.R`

# Publish -> install -> load library

- Publish the package with a `git push`.  
- Install the library by doing this in R
```R
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("githubUserName/myPackage")
library(myPackage)
```

You are ready to use your library
