Test to see if an RScala package will load properly

# R Package Skeleton Generation:
First, install the required packages by:

```R
install.packages("devtools")
library("devtools")
devtools::install_github("klutometis/roxygen")
```

To generate the directory structure of your package,
execute in R `package.skeleton("packageName")`.

Manually remove the generate `NAMESPACE` file. 
(It will be replaced by one generated by roxygen2.
But roxygen2 requires that the file not already exist.)

Also make sure to provide a title in each of the R files in the
`R` directory. It's required. You do this by adding the comments
in the first line of the function as follow:

```R
hello <- function(x) {
  #' hello
  #' @export
  print(paste("hello",x))
}
```
Also, export the function with the macro `#' @export`.


Then, to generate documentation by running the bash
script `gen.R` by doing this in a terminal:

`./gen.R`

# Publish -> install -> load library

- Publish the package with a `git push`.  
- Install the library by doing this in R
```R
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("luiarthur/testRscalaPackage")
library(testRscalaPackage)
```

You are ready to use your library
